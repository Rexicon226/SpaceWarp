Space Warp is a mod loader for Kerbal Space Program 2.
some random commit 3
Note: Use at your own risk, as this is an early version that is expected to undergo many changes.

## Installation

**It is highly recommended to use CKAN [Download Here](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN) to install Space Warp**

If you for some reason want to manually install it, here are the instructions:

Note: *Don't worry about the BepInEx installation, it already comes in the zip folder!*

Download the latest release of [UITK for KSP 2](https://github.com/jan-bures/UitkForKsp2/releases).

Drag the contents of UitkForKsp2's .zip file into your KSP2 directory, commonly located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2`.

Download the latest Space Warp release from this page under the [Releases](https://github.com/SpaceWarpDev/SpaceWarp/releases) section above.

Drag the contents of Space Warp's .zip file into your KSP2 directory, commonly located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2`.

In the case of installing on Linux under Wine/Proton, you need to override winhttp DLL in winecfg, as described [in BepInEx documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html).

To install the downloaded mods, simply drag them into the plugins folder location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program 2\BepInEx\plugins`. Remember that mods don't go into the SpaceWarp plugin folder, they go along side with it in the `BepInEx\plugins` folder.

That should be it, you can now launch the game and enjoy!

## Compiling

To compile this project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install NuGet
2. Run `nuget restore` inside the top directory to install the packages.
3. Copy everything in the `Kerbal Space Program 2\KSP2_x64_Data\Managed` folder into the `external_dlls/` folder.
4. Run one of the build scripts (see below for more info) and copy the contents from the correct build output directory into the KSP2 root director

Mods are currently implemented as monobehaviours with two fields: a `Logger` for logging and a `Manager` that points to Spacewarp. A mod template generator exists as a Python script.

## Mod Structure

The mod structure is still a work in progress. However, the current structure is as follows:

```
KSP2_Root_Folder/
├── BepInEx/
│   ├── Plugins/
│   │   ├── mod_id_folder_name/
│   │   │   ├── swinfo.json
│   │   │   ├── README.md
│   │   │   ├── assets/
│   │   │   │   ├── bundles/
│   │   │   │   │   ├── *.bundle
│   │   │   │   ├── images/
│   │   │   │   │   ├── *
│   │   │   ├── localizations/
│   │   │   │   ├── *.csv
│   │   │   ├── addressables/
│   │   │   │   ├── catalog.json
│   │   │   │   ├── *
│   │   │   ├── *.dll 
```

## Build Scripts

Each build scripts is essentially just a wrapper around `python3 builder.py $@`. The actual builder code is in `builder.py`.
Before running, open a terminal and `cd` into the repo, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies (its just `argparse`).

The build scripts are:
`build.bat` for Windows, `build.ps1` for Windows (Powershell), and `build.sh` for Linux

The available arguments are:
- `-r` or `--release` to build in release mode

When building, the build output will be in `build/SpaceWarp`, and the compressed version will be `build/SpaceWarp-[Debug|Release]-[commit].zip`.
